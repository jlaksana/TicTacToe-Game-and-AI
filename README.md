# TicTacToe-Game-and-AI
TicTacToe game with unbeatable AI using PyGame.

Goal: Create a playable Tictactoe game with an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
    and alpha-beta pruning.

This project is a playable TicTacToe game with an unbeatable AI. You can also play
in two player mode. This is my first AI project. I wanted to start off with something simple 
first. I learned about game theory, minimax algorithm, and OOP.

Instructions:
 1. Have Python 3.6 or later and the Pygame module installed
 2. Run the program
 3. Click if you want one player or two players
 4. Click which symbol player one will use
 5. Play TicTacToe by selecting a square and pressing space to add your symbol
 6. When there's a winner or draw, press space to play again.
 7. You can quit anytime with the X button on the top right.
